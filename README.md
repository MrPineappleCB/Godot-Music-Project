Drum Visualiser: Turn sounds into colour


Unfortunately this project contains a minor bug in which the player must hold the respective button and then press the spacebar for the sounds to play. This is something I will try to fix, but was unable to for the deadline.
The project still works, so this is not a major issue, just a minor annoyance. 

Contols:
Press Start Button to Begin
Enter = Hihat
Space + Left = Clap
Space + Right = Crash
Space + Up = Openhat
Space + Down = Perc
Space + Q = Ride
Space + W = Shaker
Space + E = Snare
Space  + R = Tom

Disclaimer: This project contains bright flashing colours.
